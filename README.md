<h1 align="center">Hey!</h1>

I am a software engineer with a postgraduate degree in Software Engineering and extensive experience developing a wide range of personal and professional projects. My portfolio includes web applications, automation tools, CLI utilities, bots, game cheat engines, scrapers, desktop and mobile applications, AI agents, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. I have also actively contributed to several open-source projects.

I have worked with multiple programming languages, including Go, Dart, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Lua, C++, and shell scripting, and have experience using numerous frameworks across various technology stacks.

My experience spans full-stack and backend development, as well as cybersecurity and DevSecOps. Currently, I work on the AI Platform team.

I have solid experience with cloud infrastructure, particularly AWS, and am proficient with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools such as CloudFormation, the Serverless Framework, and Terraform.

I love what I do and the endless possibilities it gives me.
