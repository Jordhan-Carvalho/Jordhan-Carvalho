<h1 align="center">Hi there 👋! I'm Jordhan !</h1>

Passionate developer with an interest in entrepreneurship who loves to architect and build new things from simple ideas to meaningful products.
 
I began my studies independently, using free online resources such as MIT OpenCourseWare and Coursera. Since then I have developed numerous personal projects, worked as a freelancer, completed a web development bootcamp, and earned a postgraduate degree in software engineering.

Despite having most of my expertise in javascript, I'm not attached to languages: I believe that for each problem we have to use the most appropriate tool, I'm open and interested in learning new languages ​​and tools. I thrive in collaborative environments that foster both intellectual and professional growth and support my continued learning.

- 👶🏼 Father of a beautiful boy 
- 💬 Feel free to ask me anything, or teach me something new.
