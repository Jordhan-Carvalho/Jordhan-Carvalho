### Hi there 👋
<h1 align="center">Hi there 👋! I'm Jordhan !</h1>

Passionate developer with an interest in entrepreneurship who loves to architect and build new things from simple ideas to meaningful products.
 
I began my studies on my own through free materials available on the internet such as MIT OpenCourseWare, Coursera, FreeCodeCamp among others, since then I have developed dozens of personal projects, worked as a freelancer, completed a web development bootcamp, started a postgraduate degree in software engineering, and nowadays I've been focusing in the backend.

Despite having most of my expertise in javascript, I'm not attached to languages: I believe that for each problem we have to use the most appropriate tool, I'm open and interested in learning new languages ​​and tools. I try to evolve in collaborative environments that provide intellectual and professional growth and encourage my learning.
