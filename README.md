<h1 align="center">Hi there!</h1>

I began my studies using freely available resources such as MIT OpenCourseWare, Coursera, FreeCodeCamp, among others. Since then, I have developed hundreds of personal and professional projects, including web applications, automation tools, bots, scrapers, desktop applications, mobile apps, and open-source projects. I have been specializing in cloud architecture and cybersecurity.

I don't have a preference for programming languages: I believe that for each problem, we should use the most appropriate tool. I strive to grow in collaborative environments that challenge my logical thinking and foster my learning.

#### A little more about me:

- 🔭 I have a bachelor's degree in geological engineering, a postgraduate degree in software engineering, and I am currently pursuing a postgraduate program in cyber security
- 😄 Vim enthusiast (Neovim actually)
- 👶🏼 Father of a beautiful boy
